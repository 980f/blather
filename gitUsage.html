    <h2>git primer for FedFIS</h2>
    <p>git is what we use to preserve and deploy IT resources such as server
      programs and configuration files.</p>
    <p>git has an enormous number of features of which we need only a few.</p>
    <p>The main feature to keep in mind is that there are always two layers of
      storage: the local <u>repo (repository)</u> and the remote. The local one
      is on your computer, in our use the remote is <code>bitbucket.org</code>
      git hosting service.</p>
    <h3>Files</h3>
    <p>In each local repo there is a <code>.git</code> directory with files you
      should never touch. <code>.git/config</code> is the most interesting one
      as it tells you what other servers this repo is connected to. Usually it
      will be obvious which one is the corporate master one, usually it is the
      only one. This is useful to know as we can rename a local repo when we
      create it, leaving you guessing as to which remote master it connects to.</p>
    <p>In any user directory in the repo there may be a <code>.gitignore</code>
      file which lists files for the git status and similar commands to ignore,
      such as program trace files which are too often written into the source
      code directories (our php code loves to do this). You may edit the <code>.gitignore</code>
      file with any plain text editor. We do that to reduce the amount of
      information in the git status command.</p>
    <h3>git status</h3>
    <p>This is something you should often run before an operation. It gives a
      listing of changes that it has noticed, and a separate listing of changes
      you have marked to be preserved.</p>
    <h3>git add <em>filename</em></h3>
    <p>adds <em>filename</em> to the list of changed files that will be
      preserved with a <code>git commit</code>. You can put more than one name
      on the command line, and also use glob patterns (<em>somename.*</em>). It
      is best practice to do <code>ls <em>whatever.*</em></code> before using
      that pattern in <code>git add</code>, it can be tedious to remove any
      unintended files. <br>
      In addition to listing changed files to be committed this command adds new
      files to control. <br>
      It is best practice to add and commit new files individually so that you
      can add a note about why it is being added to control. Of course tightly
      coupled files such as C++ .h and .cpp files are reasonable to add
      simultaneously.</p>
    <h3>git commit -m"<em>what these changes do</em>"</h3>
    <p>preserves changes and lets you annotate them. The annotations can be
      viewed with <code>git log</code>. A git <u>commit</u> is a set of
      changes, this includes edits to a file but also adds and deletes of files
      and directories.</p>
    <h3>git log</h3>
    <p>lists commits, which are sets of changes, and the note associated with
      them. <code>git log</code> is to <code>git push</code> as <code>git
        status</code> is to <code>git commit</code>, it tells you what the push
      will do.</p>
    <h3>git push</h3>
    <p>sends the changes to the remote repo. This is the first half of any
      deployment, also referred to as staging a deployment.<br>
      NB: At present (2019nov20) there is a service named Jenkins which gets
      notified of changes to our utility programs repo's and automatically
      builds a runtime package for them. Deployment of just these is done via
      maven rather than a <code>git pull</code>. See <code>workingset/update-jars.sh</code>
      for that operation.</p>
    <h3>git pull</h3>
    <p>brings changes from the remote repo to the local. For many of our files
      this constitutes deployment. <br>
      <code>git pull</code> will kindly refuse to work if you have made local
      changes that are not locally committed. <br>
      If your changes are to be preserved and later reconciled with the incoming
      ones then <code>git commit</code> your changes.<br>
      If your changes are either not quite complete or to be discarded then <code>git
        stash</code> them to keep them handy but prevent them from being
      accidentally deployed. </p>
    <h3>git stash</h3>
    <p>preserves your present uncommitted changes in a special local place and
      puts your files back to what they were at the last commit. You will have
      to read more detailed git guides to use this command other than as a way
      to drop some changes that you might want to bring back soon.</p>
    <h3>git merge</h3>
    <p>When a <code>git pull</code> fails the new remote changes are already on
      your local machine. When you have committed or stashed your local changes
      you can use <code>git merge</code> instead of issuing git pull again, to
      save on network time. <code>git merge</code> is called by <code>git pull</code>
      when there are no issues.</p>
    <hr><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/">https://git-scm.com/docs/</a> is the
    official documentation site and quite often good enough.<br>
    <hr>Other handy actions<br>
    <h3>git diff </h3>
    tells you what changes have been made since the last commit.<br>
    If you give it a filename or fileglob it will show only the changes to
    that/those files.<br>
    -w is a handy option that ignores whitespace. As we slosh back and forth to
    windows and linux occasionally the line endings change. As we use different
    editors sometimes tabs get replaced with spaces or vice versa. This will
    show you just the substantive changes.<br>
    <br>
    Some of our xml files do not have line endings in them which renders this
    operation useless.<br>
    <br>
    <hr>Expert Stuff<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Retroactive Branch</h3>
    When you have committed on the wrong branch locally but not yet pushed to
    any other repo you can retroactively branch:<br>
    <code>git branch newbranch<br>
    </code>(you can git checkout the new branch and do a git log to ensure your
    recent commits are still present)<br>
    <code>git reset --hard origin/master</code> <code><br>
    </code>where instead of master you would use the name of the branch that
    wrongly modified. Your working tree is now back to before where you started
    making changes, and all those changes are on the new branch.<br>
    You may wish to <code>git push origin newbranch</code> if the new stuff is
    useful.<br>
