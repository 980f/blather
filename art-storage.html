    <p>Storable/Stored class architecture.</p>
    <p>The ART (Applied Rigaku Technologies) software base has as its most
      significant component its configuration data storage mechanism.<br>
      The design goals are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>isolation of details of storage from the structure of what is stored</li>
      <li>both forward and backward revision compatible, as least to legibility.</li>
      <li>minimal declaration syntax and transparent syntax for business logic.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Data is maintained in disk files via the TreeFile class which contains
      JSON-like parsing and printing. Its deviations from JSON are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>arrays ("[]") are not presently explicitly supported, instead there
        are blocks of items that happen to have no names. Another way of
        expressing this is that items may be missing their "&lt;name&gt;:"
        component. Nameless items are internally numbered when parsed and their
        order is maintained.</li>
      <li>some revisions of the parser are somewhat tolerant of missing
        punctuation</li>
      <li>quoting of string values is optional on parsing, although it is
        necessary when a string value contains unescaped framing characters.</li>
      <li>the type of a value is guessed at based on its appearance: if the text
        of the value can be converted into a number then the value must be a
        number. Application code generally coerces a type on access overriding
        the parser's guess. The parser's guessing is done for diagnostic
        purposes, and to make manual patching of the files easier to do.</li>
      <li>Some revisions of the printer more aggressively use unicode escapes
        for non-ascii characters, the file is always processed as utf8 but
        people who have to hack the file have requested ascii so as to make more
        text editors usable.</li>
      <li>The JSON parts are&nbsp; internally factored such that it would be
        easy to make an XML version, or to hook up to a socket rather than to a
        disk file.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Overview of Usage</h3>
    <p>Each field that is to be non-volatile is of a class derived from Stored,
      for instance use StoredLabel for a piece of text, or StoredBoolean for a
      true/false value. <br>
      Such fields must be contained in a class derived from Stored, with a
      constructor that takes a Storable &amp;. <br>
      In the constructor of that containing class one has a
      ConnectChild(membername) initializer for each Stored<em>Something</em>
      field. <br>
      <br>
      That collection of fields is now with no further syntax stored to/from
      disk and editable via a GUI. <br>
      <br>
      Class TreeFile connects the root of a Stored<em>Something</em> to a file.
      Features exist to make it possible to automatically save on changes, but
      that is not built into any of the classes directly.</p>
    <p>To summarize:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Each datum must be declared as one of a set of "Stored" classes. <br>
        <code>StoredInt selection;</code></li>
      <li>One must have an explicit constructor invocation, there is a macro to
        make that really easy. <br>
        <code>StoredParent::StoredParent(Storable&amp;node):...
          ConnectChild(selection),</code></li>
      <li>Use it like a plain old C variable.<br>
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">... </span><code>choice =
          array[selection];&nbsp; <br>
          selection= keystroke-'0';</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>No exceptions are thrown by any of the code. <br>
      <br>
      A feature initially implemented for GUI support allows spread-sheet like
      behavior: one can register for change notifications so that a code that
      changes the value does not need to know anything about a place that must
      immediately react to such a change. This has become the major means of
      controlling behavior, api calls are done via assigning to a watched
      variable rather than traditional function calls. Code outside of the
      compilation scope can attach itself to a Stored thing, allowing decoupling
      of source modules.</p>

    <h3>Overview of implementation</h3>
    Class Storable contains the actual data storage. It is union-like in that
    the data has a type which is number, text, or collection. It is not an
    actual "C" union which is to say the ram for holding the different types of
    values is not shared. Besides the programming safety of this it allows for a
    node to have simultaneous numerical and text representations which is well
    suited for holding enum values. A collection (internally called a wad) is a
    dynamic array of nodes, forming a tree structure. The members of a
    collection have an ordinal which is efficiently accessed. This ordinal is
    handy for when the program access wishes to view the collection as an array.<br>
    <p>Class Storable has change detection and notification. The change
      detection maintains a 'dirty' bit, which can be read and cleared
      programmatically. <br>
      The notification system is based on the sigc library, version 2.0. Via
      sigc one can arrange to have set of functions called when the value of a
      node changes, and/or when a member of a collection type node is changed. <br>
      The point of a separate notification system for children of a collection
      is that it applies to children which do not exist at the time that the
      registration for the notification is made, handy for dynamically allocated
      arrays.</p>
    <p>Members of class Storable are rarely constructed as normal program
      variables. Any such instances are 'root' nodes of data trees. Most such
      root nodes are associated with disk files, a few exist without associated
      files in order to use the gui-for-Storable utilities to build screens for
      volatile data.</p>
    Classes derived from Stored are views into the Storable nodes. The Stored
    base class itself is not directly useful but has handy features for building
    derived classes.
    <p>StoredNumeric&lt;scalar&gt; template class manages a node which
      represents a number. StoredNumeric&lt;scalar&gt; syntactically is used as
      if it were a native datum of type 'scalar'. <br>
      Occasionally the compiler can't resolve an ambiguity due to function
      overloading and the .native() member must be explicitly invoked.</p>
    <p>StoredLabel manages a text node. The underlying storage in Storable uses
      a class derived from std::string that supports unicode, and as such is a
      resizable array of unicode chars. While in many situations the compiler
      can automatically call a cast to a char * or a std::string you may
      sometimes be required to resolve an ambiguity by explicitly calling
      .c_str() or .toString() on the StoredLabel.</p>
    <p>StoredGroup&lt;StoredDerivative&gt; is the template for arrays. In
      addition to collating change notifications on the value of extant members
      it has 3 notification lists for notifications related to changing the
      number of elements in the nominal array. <br>
      The three notifications lists are: just-on-add, just-before-remove, and on
      add-or-remove. <br>
      The just-on-add list is processed before the add-or-remove, allowing for
      some degree of prioritizing amongst callbacks. The just-on-remove
      similarly provides two priorities on removal call backs. <br>
      <em>History: when trying to operate via a single list of add-or-remove
        (with a boolean argument to tell which) it was hard to manage fully
        creating subordinate objects on an add before trying to present the
        newly created object in the gui. There were similar race conditions with
        removal. <br>
      </em></p>
    <p>StoredGroup&lt;&gt; has many convenient iterators and "foreach" methods.</p>
    <p>StoredGroup's can be linked to other StoredGroups such that a change to
      the quantity of members in the 'indexing' group automatically creates or
      removes a related member in the 'indexed' group. <br>
      Such connections are made via code in constructors of the objects
      containing such related arrays, so that we stay within the syntactic
      bounds of JSON and XML and avoid strict ordering of loads. <br>
      The add and remove notifiers are the main mechanism for implementing this
      relationship. <br>
      <em>History: this also simplified manual editing of configuration files,
        wherein alternative schemes involving naming the members with some text
        from the indexing group objects was hard to generalize. We have data
        structures with nominal 2-D arrays of values that are allocated 1:1 with
        a user entered list of other entities. The alternative of
        programmatically propagating adds and removes would require that the
        dependencies be listed in many places, in the business logic and each
        gui displaying such entities. By having the "connect them once" in
        constructors the gui table renderers don't explicitly know the
        relationships between such groups.</em></p>
    <em> </em>
    <p>In the guts of an application non-volatile data is represented by a class
      derived from Stored. Private constructors in Stored guarantee that the
      compiler won't create unintended duplicates of your data objects. <br>
      The non-volatile members of your class are each some class derived from
      Stored. Your constructor implementation must explicitly invoke a
      constructor for each such item for which the macro ConnectChild is
      extremely useful. <br>
      ConnectChild is a variadic macro supporting additional constructor args
      for those Stored classes which have such. <br>
      The most common such constructor argument is a default value to assign to
      the variable if a backing Storable must be created. This arrange allows
      one to delete the file behind a non-volatile structure and easily create a
      non-trivially initialized one.</p>
    <p>StoredEnum is the most peculiar Stored class in that it maintains both a
      numerical and a textual representation of a value. <br>
      The Storable node has a pointer to an Enumerizer component which relates
      text to number. <br>
      When a Storable node with a non-null Enumerizer is set to a numerical
      value the text is updated, when set to text that text is checked against
      the list and the numerical value is set to the index of that value from
      the list or a canonical 'invalid'.</p>
    <p>ConnectChild macro connects a Stored something with a Storable of the
      same name. This results in a data reflection mechanism that is used for
      the actual disk storage and for easy GUI creation. <br>
      The change notification feature of Storable can be connected to a related
      GUI element, updating in both directions on any change to the value of the
      Stored something. One creates a StoredGui control element with a reference
      to a Stored entity and no further code is needed to have that value
      presented, edited, and eventually saved to disk.</p>
    <p>TreeFile deals with actually moving data to and from disk. Storable
      itself yields up names and values to TreeFile. So while Storable can
      retain all the content of some JSON data, it isn't tied to that format.</p>
    <h3>Deeper Details</h3>
    <p>The StoredNumeric&lt;<em>Scalar</em>&gt; class has sigc::slot generators
      for such actions as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> deferred setting of a value: "set this node to 2 when the slot I'm
        returning is called", </li>
      <li>propagation to non-Stored stuff: "when your value changes set this
        plain old variable to the new value", </li>
      <li>send a value on change: "add a change notification functional that
        calls the function I am providing now with the value you acquire
        whenever".&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Stored base class has 'after parse' and 'before print' hooks so that
      one can make major transformations of representation to and from storage.
      <br>
      The prime use is for storing data that is declared and operated on as
      simple structs not needing change notifications et al, just needing to be
      stored with the data designed for use via Storable/Stored. <br>
      Another significant has been converting a large but sparse array of
      integers into a compact text notation. The sparse array was maintained in
      business logic as a plain old C array, but run to storage compressed into
      a single ascii string.</p>
    <p>The name member of a Storable is implemented with a very simple string
      class which doesn't allow for editing of its content. <br>
      This class (TextKey) wraps a const char * and carefully administers
      strdup() and free() to not leak data, and to not keep references to the
      strings from the parsing process.</p>
    <p>Storable instances have a pointer to the containing Storable (null for
      root nodes) which allows one to discover the context for problems that
      occur, such as trying to set a numerical node to a string value. <br>
      This also makes version upgrades easy to code, where a field gets moved to
      a deeper struct one can easily go looking for a value from its former
      location.<br>
      <br>
      You can find a child member of a node by a path expression. In the
      'desktop' version of this mechanism the path is a pipe separated list of
      names. In the 'safely' version of this mechanism '.' and '..' are allowed
      (and a slash rather than a pipe is used) which allows you to construct
      relative paths to siblings and parents versus the former version of the
      lib which can only find children.</p>
    <p>Storable instances have an index that is maintained automatically as
      sibling nodes are created or destroyed. This is usually only relevant to
      the nodes that back StoredGroup instances, but are present on all nodes.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3>GUI considerations (gtk vintage)</h3>
    <p>Gui's for configuration data are a mix of labeled cells and tables. <br>
      For each type of data editing interaction there is a single field editor
      GUI class, and a table column assistant. <br>
      A StoredBoolean (StoredNumeric&lt;bool&gt;) has a gui element which is a
      toggle button, a StoredEnum gui element is a button which presents a list
      to pick from. <br>
      The others bring up screens with keyboards and data display windows. Each
      such element is passed a reference to a Stored<em>Something</em>.</p>
    <p>The tables are a nightmare of a different order. The underlying GTK
      widget is a tree editor and took a long time to tame. <br>
      Now one makes a table by providing a line of code per column, in which
      declaration one provides a text path into the Storable tree behind one's
      Stored object that backs the field you wish to edit. <br>
      One provides the table with a StoredGroup whose members represent the rows
      of the table. Once that is done (with only one line of code for each
      aforementioned action) any changes to fields or the quantity of Group
      members is automatically reflected in the table.</p>
    <h3>Major attitudes</h3>
    <p>The parser is the most reworked section of the code. The first pass had a
      tendency to merrily spiral out of control on small syntax errors. <br>
      A fancy version that was geared toward being guided by the Stored entities
      was too slow to deploy (minutes vs seconds), and was contrary to
      separating the transport mechanism from the program logic. <br>
      One loses the ability to complain about incorrectly formatted files, but
      in fact most "incorrect formatting" is due to being an older (or later)
      version and we wish to be graceful about accommodating up and down grades.
      <br>
      <br>
      The file printer and parser adds a field in the top level collection with
      the revision number of the code, which can be used to invoke some
      transformations. <br>
      Mostly, however, upgrades are done via code in each Stored class
      constructor that checks for default initialized content (there are state
      flags for that) and can reference other fields to transform old values
      into new. <br>
      Nodes of a collection node have a pointer to their parent and thus one can
      walk up, down, and around the Storable tree to find legacy values. <br>
      Out of 11 major releases of the major application built with code only a
      very few fields haven't survived an upgrade, few enough to list in release
      notes for manual migration.</p>
    <h3>Cheap Tricks</h3>
    <p>The Storable class uses separate data members for each type of node,
      where one might have used a union. <br>
      That has allowed for slipping some debug information into the tree, such
      as a text value on a collection node. <br>
      TreeFile does this to store the resolved absolute path name of its file,
      purely for snooping on with a debugger.</p>
    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <p>Finish preliminary work on sorting the children of large collections for
      binary searching. As the only large collection is the localization
      disctionary present experiments are done externally to the Storable class,
      maintaining a sorted index. <br>
      That wasn't deployed as we could not determine that we had a performance
      issue that needed such a fix.</p>
    <p>Make TreeFile internally allocate the root node (presently one creates
      one and passes it to TreeFile), and create those from a static member node
      so that one can programmatically traverse a list of files for "save all"
      functionality. </p>
    <p>The 'safely' version has a JSON parser that can update a tree, the
      'desktop' vintage insists on creating a new node even if a node of the
      same name exists.</p>
    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p>The design for the storage parts are by Andy H.<br>
      David B. did the hard parts of the table editor and most editor gui
      controls, with Andy H compacting the syntax for legibility and to
      encourage uniform use.</p>
