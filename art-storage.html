    <p>Storable/Stored class architecture.</p>
    <p>The ART (Applied Rigaku Technologies) software base has as its most
      significant component its configuration data storage mechanism.<br>
      The design goals are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>isolation of details of storage from the structure of what is stored</li>
      <li>both forward and backward revision compatible, as least to legibility.</li>
      <li>minimal declaration syntax and transparent syntax for business logic.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Data is maintained in disk files via the TreeFile class which contains
      JSON-like parsing and printing. Its deviations from JSON are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>arrays ("[]") are not presently explicitly supported, instead there
        are blocks of items that happen to have no names. Another way of
        expressing this is that items may be missing their "&lt;name&gt;:"
        component. Nameless items are internally numbered when parsed and their
        order is maintained.</li>
      <li>some revisions of the parser are somewhat tolerant of missing
        punctuation</li>
      <li>quoting of string values is optional on parsing, although it is
        necessary when a string value contains unescaped framing characters.</li>
      <li>the type of a value is guessed at based on its appearance: if the text
        of the value can be converted into a number then the value must be a
        number. Application code generally coerces a type on access overriding
        the parser's guess. The parser's guessing is done for diagnostic
        purposes, and to make manual patching of the files easier to do.</li>
      <li>Some revisions of the printer more aggressively use unicode escapes
        for non-ascii characters, the file is always processed as utf8 but
        people who have to hack the file have requested ascii so as to make more
        text editors usable.</li>
      <li>The JSON parts are&nbsp; internally factored such that it would be
        easy to make an XML version, or to hook up to a socket rather than to a
        disk file.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Overview of Usage</h3>
    <p>Each field that is to be non-volatile is of a class derived from Stored,
      for instance use StoredLabel for a piece of text, or StoredBoolean for a
      true/false value. Such fields must be contained in a class derived from
      Stored, with a constructor that takes a Storable &amp;. In the constructor
      of that containing class one has a ConnectChild(membername) for each
      Stored<em>Something</em> field. <br>
      That collection of fields is now with no further syntax stored to/from
      disk and editable via a GUI. <br>
      Class TreeFile connects the root of a Stored<em>Something</em> to a file.
      Features exist to make it possible to automatically save on changes, but
      that is not built into any of the classes directly.</p>
    <p>To summarize:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Each datum must be declared as one of a set of "Stored" classes. <br>
        <code>StoredInt selection;</code></li>
      <li>One must have an explicit constructor invocation, there is a macro to
        make that really easy. <br>
        <code>StoredParent::StoredParent(Storable&amp;node):...
          ConnectChild(selection),</code></li>
      <li>Use it like a plain old C variable.<br>
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">... </span><code>choice =
          array[selection];&nbsp; <br>
          selection= keystroke-'0';</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>No exceptions are thrown by any of the code. <br>
      <br>
      A feature implemented for GUI support allows spread-sheet like behavior:
      one can register for change notifications so that a code that changes the
      value does not need to know anything about a place that must immediately
      react to such a change.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Overview of implementation</h3>
    <p>Class Storable contains the actual data storage. It is union-like in that
      the data has a type which is number, text, or collection. It is not an
      actual "C" union which is to say the ram for holding the different types
      of values is not shared. Besides the programming safety of this it allows
      for a node to have simultaneous numerical and text representations which
      is well suited for holding enum values. A collection (internally called a
      wad) is a dynamic array of nodes, forming a tree structure. The members of
      a collection have an ordinal which is efficiently accessed. This ordinal
      is handy for when the program access wishes to view the collection as an
      array.</p>
    <p>Class Storable has change detection and notification. The change
      detection maintains a 'dirty' bit, which can be read and cleared
      programmatically. The notification system is based on the sigc library,
      version 2.0. Via sigc one can arrange to have set of functions called when
      the value of a node changes, and/or when a member of a collection type
      node is changed. The point of a separate notification system for children
      of a collection is that it applies to children which do not exist at the
      time that the registration for the notification is made, handy for arrays.</p>
    <p>Members of class Storable are rarely constructed as normal program
      variables. Any such instances are 'root' nodes of data trees. Most such
      root nodes are associated with disk files, a few exist without associated
      files in order to use the gui-for-Storable utilities to build screens for
      volatile data.</p>
    <p><br>
      Classes derived from Stored are views into the Storable nodes. The Stored
      base class itself is not directly useful but has handy features for
      building derived classes.</p>
    <p>StoredNumeric&lt;scalar&gt; template class manages a node which
      represents a number. StoredNumeric&lt;scalar&gt; syntactically is used as
      if it were a native datum of type 'scalar'. Occasionally the compiler
      can't resolve an ambiguity due to function overloading and the .native()
      member must be explicitly invoked.</p>
    <p>StoredLabel manages a text node. The underlying storage in Storable uses
      a class derived from std::string that supports unicode, and as such is a
      resizable array of unicode chars. While in many situations the compiler
      can automatically call a cast to a char * or a std::string you may
      sometimes be required to resolve an ambiguity by explicitly calling
      .c_str() or .toString() on the StoredLabel.</p>
    <p>StoredGroup&lt;StoredDerivative&gt; is the template for arrays. In
      addition to collating change notifications on the value of extant members
      it has 3 notification lists for notifications related to changing the
      number of elements in the nominal array. The three notifications lists
      are: just-on-add, just-before-remove, and on add-or-remove. The
      just-on-add list is processed before the add-or-remove, allowing for some
      degree of prioritizing amongst callbacks. The just-on-remove similarly
      provides two priorities on removal call backs. When trying to operate via
      a single list of add-or-remove (with a boolean argument to tell which) it
      was hard to manage fully creating subordinate objects on an add before
      trying to present the newly created object in the gui. There were similar
      race conditions with removal. StoredGroup&lt;&gt; has many convenient
      iterators.</p>
    <p>StoredGroup's can be subordinate to other StoredGroups such that a change
      to the quantity of members in the 'indexing' group automatically creates
      or removes a related member in the 'indexed' group. Such connections are
      made via code in constructors of the objects containing such related
      arrays, so that we stay within the syntactic bounds of JSON and XML and
      avoid strict ordering of loads. The add and remove notifiers are the main
      mechanism for implementing this relationship. This also simplified manual
      editing of configuration files, wherein alternative schemes involving
      naming the members with some text from the indexing group objects was hard
      to generalize. We have data structures with nominal 2-D arrays of values
      that are allocated 1:1 with a user entered list of other entities. The
      alternative of programmatically propagating adds and removes would require
      that the dependencies be listed in many places, in the business logic and
      each gui displaying such entities. By having the "connect them once" the
      gui table renderers don't explicitly know the relationships between such
      groups.</p>
    <p>In the guts of an application non-volatile data is represented by a class
      derived from Stored. Private constructors in Stored guarantee that the
      compiler won't create unintended duplicates of your data objects. The
      non-volatile members of your class are each some class derived from
      Stored. Your constructor implementation must explicitly invoke a
      constructor for each such item for which the macro ConnectChild is
      extremely useful. ConnectChild is a variadic macro supporting additional
      constructor args for those Stored classes which have such. The most common
      such constructor argument is a default value to assign to the variable if
      a backing Storable must be created. The latter means that one may delete
      the file behind a non-volatile structure and the program will create a
      non-trivially initialized one.</p>
    <p>StoredEnum is the most peculiar Stored class in that it maintains both a
      numerical and a textual representation of a value. The Storable node has a
      pointer to an Enumerizer component which relates text to number. When a
      Storable node with a non-null Enumerizer is set to a numerical value the
      text is updated, when set to text that text is checked against the list
      and the numerical value is set to the value from the list or a canonical
      'invalid'.</p>
    <p>ConnectChild connects a Stored something with a Storable of the same
      name. This results in a data reflection mechanism that is used for the
      actual disk storage and for easy GUI creation. The change notification
      feature of Storable causes a related GUI element to be updated on any
      change to the value of the Stored something. One creates a StoredGui
      control element with a reference to a Stored entity and no further code is
      needed to have that value presented, edited, and eventually saved to disk.</p>
    <p>TreeFile deals with actually moving data to and from disk. Storable
      itself yields up names and values to TreeFile. So while Storable can
      retain all the content of some JSON data, it isn't tied to that format.</p>
    <h3>Deeper Details</h3>
    <p>The StoredNumeric&lt;<em>Scalar</em>&gt; class has sigc::slot generators
      for such actions as deferred setting of a value "sets the node to 2 when
      the slot I'm returning is called", propagation to non-Stored stuff "when
      your value changes set this plain old variable to the new value", send a
      value on change "add a change notification functional that calls the
      function I am providing now with the value you acquire whenever".&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Stored base class has 'after parse' and 'before print' hooks so that
      one can make major transformations of representation to and from storage.
      The prime use is for storing data that is declared and operated on as
      simple structs not needing change notifications et al, just needing to be
      stored with the data designed for use via Storable/Stored. Another
      significant use was converting a large but sparse array of integers into a
      compact text notation. The sparse array was maintained in business logic
      as a plain old C array, but run to storage compressed into a single ascii
      string.</p>
    <p>The name member of a Storable is implemented with a very simple string
      class which doesn't allow for editing of its content. The class (TextKey)
      wraps a const char * and carefully administers strdup() and free() to not
      leak data, and to not keep references to the strings from the parsing
      process.</p>
    <p>Storable instances have a pointer to the containing Storable (null for
      root nodes) which allows one to discover the context for problems that
      occur, such as trying to set a numerical node to a string value. This also
      makes version upgrades easy to code, where a field gets moved to a deeper
      struct one can easily go looking for a value from its former location.</p>
    <h3>GUI considerations</h3>
    <p>Gui's for configuration data are a mix of labeled cells and tables. For
      each type of data editing interaction there is a single field editor GUI
      class, and a table column assistant. A StoredBoolean
      (StoredNumeric&lt;bool&gt;) has a gui element which is a toggle button, a
      StoredEnum gui element is a button which presents a list to pick from. The
      others bring up screens with keyboards and data display windows. Each such
      element is passed a reference to a Stored<em>Something</em>.</p>
    <p>The tables are a nightmare of a different order. The underlying GTK
      widget is a tree editor and took a long time to tame. Now one makes a
      table by providing a line of code per column, in which declaration one
      provides a text path into the Storable tree behind one's Stored object
      that backs the field you wish to edit. One provides the table with a
      StoredGroup whose members represent the rows of the table. Once that is
      done (with only one line of code for each aforementioned action) any
      changes to fields or the quantity of Group members is automatically
      reflected in the table.</p>
    <h3>Major attitudes</h3>
    <p>The parser is the most reworked section of the code. The first pass had a
      tendency to merrily spiral out of control on small syntax errors. A fancy
      version that was geared toward being guided by the Stored entities was too
      slow to deploy (minutes vs seconds), and was contrary to separating the
      transport mechanism from the program logic. One loses the ability to
      complain about incorrectly formatted files, but in fact most "incorrect
      formatting" is due to being an older (or later) version and we wish to be
      graceful about accommodating up and down grades. The file printer and
      parser adds a field in the top level collection with the revision number
      of the code, which can be used to invoke some transformations. Mostly
      however, upgrades are done via code in a Stored class constructor that
      checks for default initialized content (there are state flags for that)
      and can reference other fields to transform old values into new. Nodes of
      a collection node have a pointer to their parent and thus one can walk up,
      down, and around the Storable tree to find legacy values. Out of 11 major
      releases of the major application built with code only a very few fields
      haven't survived an upgrade, few enough to list in release notes.</p>
    <h3>Cheap Tricks</h3>
    <p>The Storable class uses separate data members for each type of node,
      where one might have used a union. That has allowed for slipping some
      debug information into the tree, such as a text value on a collection
      node. TreeFile does this to store the resolved absolute path name of its
      file, purely for snooping on with a debugger.</p>
    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <p>Finish preliminary work on sorting the children of large collections for
      binary searching. As the only large collection is the localization string
      set present experiments are done externally to the Storable class,&nbsp;
      maintaining a sorted index. That isn't ready for deployment as it is hard
      to prove that we don't have a use after free. As I write this I have
      figured out how to fix that!</p>
    <p>Make TreeFile internally allocate the root node (presently one creates
      one and passes it to TreeFile), and create those from a static member node
      so that one can programmatically traverse a list of files for "save all" functionality.
