    <p>Kotlin features</p>
    <ol>
      <li>runs on jvm, including current Android</li>
      <li>less syntax, e.g. semicolons are mostly optional</li>
      <li>'if' and 'switch' have values, fancier than just a ternary and
        replaces ternary.</li>
      <li>blocks have the value of the last statement in the block.</li>
      <li>null checking is very compact</li>
      <li>functions are first class objects, callbacks are easy to write.</li>
      <li>can add methods to a class outside of the class. Useful for packaging
        local usage patterns for a system library, with method syntax.</li>
      <li>'delegation' is almost multiple inheritance, you have to manually
        instantiate the other true objects but it is easy to access them
        transparently (i.e. without having to explicitly mention the
        implementing object for each method invocation)</li>
      <li>nicer enum than java, C-like values, java-like string utilities</li>
      <li>instead of C++ operator= and operator &amp; overloads you get setters
        and getters very much like C#.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>operators can be overloaded, but assignment is not an operator.</li>
      <li>Generics are more compile time (C++ templates) than java style
        (compiler generated casts on shared code), mostly stricter type checking
        by default.</li>
      <li>really nice 'auto', after a type check the variable is considered to
        be of the type just (successfully) checked for.</li>
      <li>function taking a function argument doesn't need parens, making for
        some interesting syntax for document models. </li>
      <li>nice casting syntax, supports c++ dynamic_cast as well as static_cast.</li>
      <li>switch statement is more capable (e.g. has a value) but syntactically
        way different than most main stream languages. Actually it is pretty
        much like Visual Basic's. Especially useful is that the cases can be
        runtime computed expressions, in essence the switch is exactly an
        if-else if.</li>
      <li>Arrays of native types are actually such, versus being an array of
        boxed native types which the syntax implies.</li>
      <li>can be compiled into javascript, in which case there are additional
        language features. That means you can share code between client and
        server with the client being javascript in a browser but the server
        being jvm.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>weirdnesses:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>const'ness is less visible albeit easier to declare ('val' instead of
        'var', nasty for Japanese programmers).</li>
      <li>constructor syntax has many variations. The coolest one is what looks
        like an argument declaration list, with optional initializers.</li>
      <li>'sealed' class, appears to be where all instances of the class are
        defined at compile time. They are still mutable but you can't destroy
        them nor create instances of your own at runtime.</li>
      <li>switch statement syntax requires that the 'default' clause trail all
        others. Implementation is promised to be the same as if-else-if on the
        case statements so the trade-off is sorta ok. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>other thoughts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>supported by the best java IDE and as such one can switch handily
        between it and java. Also supported by the second best java IDE
        (eclipse).</li>
      <li>supported by the Android runtime.</li>
      <li>much more compact and expressive than java (much nicer functional
        programming), but still java 'under the hood', but not as twisted
        syntactically as C++, nor as sloppy as Python.</li>
    </ol>
