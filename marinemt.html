    <p>MT marine data acquisition system</p>
    <p>Requirements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>battery operated, 12 hours run time</li>
      <li> sealed against moisture (affects heat dissipation)</li>
      <li>2 to 5 channels EM data, 2kHz typical, 5kHz desired, 18 bits(4 bytes@4/8kHz = 16/32k bytes/second ~1GB/shift)</li>
      <li>many channels for depth measurement, 10 Hz data (perhaps 50/60Hz sampling?) 12 bits</li>
      <ol>
        <li>water temperature</li>
        <li>water pressure</li>
        <li>"bubble level" info, 3-axis gyro (raw data rate ~100Hz * 6 bytes)</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p><br>
      Suggested architecture:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>MCU (micro controller) at detector (e.g. SAMD21 series)</li>
      <li>SDcard for data logging at mcu, as a backup. Raw disk storage, no file system required.</li>
      <li>Linux capable SBC (single board computer), Raspberry Pi or similar.</li>
      <li>USB "pen/thumb" drive on SBC for primary data logging. Use journalling filesystem for higher reliability.</li>
      <li>The SBC is above water and connects to the GPS receiver system.</li>
      <li>The SBC may have a wifi connection or other communications with the boat, if only flashing lights to say "service
        required".</li>
      <li>The SBC connects to the MCU via fiber-optic or RS-485 serial port, perhaps just one way MCU to SBC (250kbaud MCU out, a
        dribble in the reverse direction).</li>
      <li>With each data acquisition the MCU stores a timestamped/sequenced number record in its local SDcard, and sends the same
        content on to the SBC.</li>
      <li>The SDcard non-filesystem storage exists as a backup to the SBC, presumable both will not fail at the same time. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Attitudes</p>
    <ol>
      <li>MCU SDcard storage is not generally seen as reliable, and is definitely not sophisticated with respect to robustness. Fire
        codes or other ECC can be used for this data. Each record has identifying information so no file system is required.</li>
      <li>The SBC is running linux so that it can read such SDcard info without much grief.</li>
      <li>The SBC can do data validation on the fly, checking for whether the data acquisition process seems sane. It also records
        GPS-MCU record# correlation information.</li>
      <li>The SBC can save the data in multiple separate drives for redundancy.</li>
      <li>The SBC restart-on-failure time equates to ~150k records, which the MCU SDcard can retain. </li>
      <li>No SBC running anything worthy of being called an OS will have the real time performance needed for the M-T signal
        processing, nor do many of them have the I/O for simple collection of sensor data. The minimal 'dumb' circuitry needed to
        provide such I/O is not cheaper nor smaller than an MCU with enough pins. The possible exception to the "OS's jitter too
        much" is uCLinux and its peers, which however entail greater development burdens than mating an easily-real-time MCU with a
        well supported OS for connection to the rest of the world.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Implementation details</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The MCU should be acquiring data via DMA for lowest power, or an ISR doing not much more than buffer insertions.</li>
      <li>The data should be assembled into chunks of a size that admits of the appropriate ECC for the storage and transmission
        media.</li>
      <li>if the MCU and SBC</li>
    </ol>
