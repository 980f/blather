    <p>MT marine data acquisition system</p>
    <p>Requirements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>battery operated, 12 hours run time</li>
      <li> sealed against moisture (affects heat dissipation)</li>
      <li>2 to 5 channels EM data, 2kHz typical, 5kHz desired, 18 bits(4 bytes@4/8kHz = 16/32k bytes/second ~1GB/shift)</li>
      <li>many ADC channels for depth measurement, 10 Hz data (perhaps 50/60Hz sampling?) 12 bits each</li>
      <ol>
        <li>water temperature</li>
        <li>water pressure</li>
        <li>"bubble level" </li>
        <li>? 6-axis gyro/accelerometer (raw data rate ~100Hz * 6 bytes)</li>
        <li>? magnetometer (for rough check on whether induced currents are the source of large signals in coil)</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <p><br>
      Suggested architecture:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>MCU (micro controller) at detector (e.g. SAMD21 series)</li>
      <li>SDcard for data logging at mcu, as a backup. Raw disk storage OK, no file system required.</li>
      <li>Linux capable SBC (single board computer), Raspberry Pi or similar.</li>
      <li>USB "pen/thumb" drive on SBC for primary data logging. Use journalLing filesystem for higher reliability.</li>
      <li>The SBC is above water and connects to the GPS receiver system.</li>
      <li>The SBC may have a wifi connection or other communications with the boat, if only flashing lights to say "service required".</li>
      <li>The SBC connects to the MCU via fiber-optic or RS-485 serial port, perhaps just one way MCU to SBC (250kbaud MCU out, a dribble in the reverse direction).</li>
      <li>With each data acquisition the MCU stores a timestamped/sequenced number record in its local SDcard, and sends the same content on to the SBC.</li>
      <li>The SDcard non-filesystem storage exists as a backup to the SBC, presumable both will not fail at the same time. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Attitudes</p>
    <ol>
      <li>MCU SDcard storage is not generally seen as reliable, and is definitely not sophisticated with respect to robustness. Fire codes or other ECC can be used for
        this data. Each record has identifying information so no file system is required.</li>
      <li>The SBC is running linux so that it can read such SDcard info without much grief.</li>
      <li>The SBC can do data validation on the fly, checking for whether the data acquisition process seems sane. It also records GPS-MCU record# correlation
        information.</li>
      <li>The SBC can save the data in multiple separate drives for redundancy.</li>
      <li>The SBC restart-on-failure time equates to ~150k records, which the MCU SDcard can retain. </li>
      <li>No SBC running anything worthy of being called an OS will have the real time performance needed for the M-T signal processing, nor do many of them have the
        I/O for simple collection of sensor data. The minimal 'dumb' circuitry needed to provide such I/O is not cheaper nor smaller than an MCU with enough pins. The
        possible exception to the "OS's jitter too much" is uCLinux and its peers, which however entail greater development burdens than mating an easily-real-time MCU
        with a well supported OS for connection to the rest of the world.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Implementation details</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The MCU should be acquiring data via DMA for lowest power, or an ISR doing not much more than buffer insertions.</li>
      <li>The&nbsp;MCU should assemble data&nbsp; into chunks of a size that admits of the appropriate ECC for the storage and transmission media.</li>
      <li>Logging should NOT be done to the media which holds the OS+programs.</li>
      <li>One logging format could be sqlite database, a binary format that works on many operation systems.</li>
      <li>Linux allows different file systems on different devices, so the redundant filing of data to multiple devices can use different filesystems on each for
        different failure modes.</li>
      <li>Commands SBC to MCA:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>"you should be acquiring data"</li>
        <li>"save power"</li>
        <li>"please resend records x..y" (for when the SBC has restarted pursuant to some screwup)</li>
      </ol>
      <li>MCA to SBC</li>
      <ol>
        <li>mtdatum: a sequence number and 2 or more channels of coil data.</li>
        <li>otherdata: gyro/accelerometer/tilt sensor data.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <ol>
