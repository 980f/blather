    <p>crossworks 3.7.4&nbsp; <br>
      ubuntu 16.04 on x86_64<br>
      (crossworks 3.6.5 had been installed and used)</p>
    <p>3.6.5 wouldn't change the UI font, it ignored all the settings I could find. The font was too small for me to work.</p>
    <p>Installation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>why must we run it as root? </li>
      <ol>
        <li>I don't install to a system path.</li>
        <li>I did not get a desktop icon</li>
        <li>I did not get a unity launcher icon</li>
        <li>Mime type registry didn't link anything to hzp files:<br>
          some part of the install gets fresh with the mime-types file: <code>"Warning in file "/usr/share/applications/gnumeric.desktop": usage of MIME type
            "zz-application/zz-winassoc-xls" is discouraged ("zz-application/zz-winassoc-xls" should be replaced with "application/vnd.ms-excel")<br>
            Unknown media type in type 'all/all'<br>
            Unknown media type in type 'all/allfiles'"</code><br>
          I'm guessing that comes from some registry system call y'all are making.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>Usability</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Low contrast and small fonts on many data types (disassembler code listing addresses)</li>
      <ol>
        <li>It took a bit of scrounging around to find all the different font setting places. </li>
        <li>There are items in the keymap for adjusting font (my eyes do get tired around hour 12 of a shift ) but no mechanism for assigning a key to them. I'm running
          in free mode at the moment, learning linker stuff so maybe I would get that if I paid.</li>
        <li>a font that has a bigger difference between capitol O and zero would be nice. Since you automatically recognize number literals you could give them their
          own font setting instead of just a color.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>When I have the cursor on a #include line it would be nice to have a quick way to go to that file, it is tedious to move to it, right click and then have to
        pick it from the list provided.</li>
      <li>ld file editor doesn't seem to know about include files. The usual menu for includes pops up but is empty.</li>
      <li>Two crash reports in one session, both on closing the studio.</li>
      <li>BIG: Does not remember locals' view choices such as a preference for an output type for a particular variable. This is especially painful when you traverse
        function calls and call again into a routine which then has lost all your preferences since the last visit just a few steps ago. Qtcreator+gdb does this and it
        really is very wearying to not have it.</li>
      <ol>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>Bugs</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Changing 'exclude from build' does not trigger a rebuild when you ask for a build. You must explicitly rebuild.</li>
      <li>Disassembly often treats code as data. I understand this is a hard problem, what with debug line labels not clearly being code vs. data, but once the program
        counter lands on some 'data' while stepping in the debug window it would be nice to re-disassemble with a note that that point is code. Same goes for elf file
        reader, .o file reader, errors are at same spots in each. Methinks there is a binary parsing error on recognizing certain instruction patterns.</li>
      <li>When ctrl +shift on a character has no special function the character gets passed through as a plain shifted char instead of ignored. trying to un-comment by
        ctrl+shift+/ I got a '?' inserted into the text. The menu item works so perhaps it is the ibus that is screwing up and not passing that combo to you.</li>
      <li>if I blank the linker startup symbol the "-e<i>startup</i>" is still put into the linker command, and since the next argument is --omagic I get that "--omagic
        is not found". The -e option is meaningless for cortex-M parts so it would be nice to not have to coordinate a useless name between files (I have my own startup
        system).</li>
