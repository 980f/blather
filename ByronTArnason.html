    <h2>Byron and me</h2>
    Byron and I first met as contractors working on a con-focal scanning laser microscope, a device capable of 3-D imaging of surfaces. The goal was to make a low cost version, existing ones cost $100k or more, this was in 1988 or so. Our task was to design one that could retail under $40k. <br>
    <br>
    We worked after hours on it, I was still recovering from a divorce and needed the extra income as well as distraction from my misery. <br>
    We were using an infrared laser. I stated that I could see the beam and Byron scoffed at that. He set up a test, I passed it, and he accepted that I could do so, an example of him honoring facts over academic&nbsp; orthodoxy.&nbsp; The project had us travel a time or two and that led to some long into the night discussions on everything. Among the things I learned about him is that he had a remote relationship to his father, that he felt bad about Maida nearly dying from pregnancy or childbirth, and he had great hostility against child molesters. Having been seriously molested to where it was the driving force behind my estrangement to my father (and vulnerability to narcissists), details of which I never provided to Byron, I have to wonder why he felt so strongly about the issue.<br>
    <br>
    The project was a technical success, and showed that there was no market for such a device. Within a few years we were both working at the XRF company whose owner had sponsored the laser microcscope, Asoma Instruments.<br>
    During our work together Byron taught me how to apply first principles to electronic&nbsp; circuitry, and how they fail. He annoyed just about everybody else by his superiority, which is all the more annoying when the person actually is superior. The modus of his offence would be to say "C'mon, you should know better" simultaneously expressing appreciation for the person's ability while pointing out that they were not using it. Unlike the others I chose to learn as much as he would teach me.<br>
    <br>
    Corporate politics ended up with him being transferred from R&amp;D to Service Manager, where he was expected to fail. Instead he continued his annoying ways by doing an excellent job of it, including supporting our Spanish speaking representatives and customers. His Spanish sounded just like his English, not a hint of a Spanish or Mexican accent to it, but was nonetheless comprehensible by our clients :)<br>
    <br>
    He ended up moving on and eventually I did as well, although I ended up returning to Asoma.<br>
    <br>
    In 2009 I got reacquainted with Byron when I introduced my girlfriend of the time to G&amp;S. Byron was house manager and recruited me to usher. I ushered the remaining shows and pretty much every show every year since, when I am not working back stage. For a few of those years we worked the auditions together, giving us lots of time to talk about many topics.<br>
    <br>
    While it started before Trump with climate change denial, Trump and the pandemic finally severed us. Byron supported Trump, using arguments that he would have derided if applied on any other topic. I wrote it off to a naive expectation that the destruction of the federal government would provide opportunities for him to claim and work a gold mine.&nbsp; Shortly before that he invited me to join in on quoting a project to prospect for geothermal sites in some South American country. Byron eventually decided he didn't want to participate as he felt the project was mostly intended to scam money from that government. You can see that I was then surprised when he supported Trump. I finally gave up arguing and simply quit communicating with him, a loss I felt each time I did and do anything with G&amp;S. <br>
