    <p>Dembski on conservation of information</p>
    <p>https://evolutionnews.org/2012/08/conservation_of/</p>
    <p><br>
      Just pointing out the fallacies here.</p>
    <p>"Conservation of information is not a difficult concept and once it is understood, it becomes clear that evolutionary processes cannot create the information
      required to power biological evolution."</p>
    <p>Much todo is made of the concept of "search". <br>
      "Nonetheless, for Kauffman, nature, in powering the evolutionary process, is engaged in a search through biological configuration space, searching for and finding
      ever-increasing orders of biological complexity and diversity." <br>
      Besides being an appeal to authority Kauffman is quite wrong in that evolution doesn't search for complexity and diversity. <br>
      The vast number of diverse organisms are simple, only a few are complex (compare the number of species of bacteria to the number of species of apes). <br>
      The frequency of extinction by itself contradicts diversity being a goal vs a means.<br>
      Evolution seeks local fitness, if complexity gets you there then you will get complexity, if not you won't.</p>
    <hr>"The physical world is life-permitting — its structure and laws allow (though they are far from necessitating) the existence of not just cellular life but also
    intelligent multicellular life. For the physical world to be life-permitting in this way, its laws and fundamental constants need to be configured in very precise
    ways. Moreover, it seems far from mandatory that those laws and constants had to take the precise form that they do. The universe itself, therefore, can be viewed
    as the solution to the problem of making life possible. But problem solving itself is a form of search, namely, finding the solution (among a range of candidates)
    to the problem."<br>
    An aside: the ~2% variation in parameters is far from 'precise' to someone like me who has to make systems work to better than a part per billion before they ship.
    I'll take up the fine tuning fallacy elsewhere.<br>
    <br>
    A point I agree on:<br>
    "Mathematically speaking, search always occurs against a backdrop of possibilities (the <em>search space</em>), with the search being for a subset within this
    backdrop of possibilities (known as the <em>target</em>). Success and failure of search are then characterized in terms of a probability distribution over this
    backdrop of possibilities, the probability of success increasing to the degree that the probability of locating the target increases." Notice well "the probability
    of success increasing ..." suggests that the probabilities are dynamic.<br>
    <hr>"Take an Easter egg hunt in which there’s just one egg carefully hidden somewhere in a vast area. This is the target and blind search is highly unlikely to find
    it precisely because the search space is so vast. But there’s still a positive probability of finding the egg even with blind search, and if the egg is discovered,
    then that’s just how it is. It may be, because the egg’s discovery is so improbable, that we might question whether the search was truly blind and therefore reject
    this (null) hypothesis. Maybe it was a guided search in which someone, with knowledge of the egg’s whereabouts, told the seeker “warm, warmer, no colder, warmer,
    warmer, hot, hotter, you’re burning up.” Such guidance gives the seeker added information that, if the information is accurate, will help locate the egg with much
    higher probability than mere blind search — this added information changes the probability distribution."&nbsp; the last sentence is not true, it does not alter any
    probability distribution as defined in the start of the paragraph, it instead alters the search space.&nbsp;<br>
    <p> That is not a trivial distinction. It replaces one probability with a different one, it does not alter the first as a probability distribution is inseparable
      from the space over which it is defined.</p>
    <hr>On knockout experiments:<br>
    "So where’s the problem for evolution in all this? Granted, the selection regime here is a case of artificial selection — the experimenter is carefully controlling
    the bacterial environment, deciding which bacteria get to live or die." NO, the scientist does not decide which bacteria live or die, nor does their environment,
    their fitness affects their probability of surviving- the word 'decide' implies a designer/god and as such leads to a circular argument.<br>
    <br>
    <hr><br>
    "Yes, these bacteria are gaining new information, but they are gaining it from their environments, environments that, presumably, need not be subject to intelligent
    guidance. No experimenter, applying artificial selection, for instance, set out to produce nylonase." constitutes a definition of information. That information,
    that a particular protein allows use of a novel food source, is not present in the environment and the bacterium did not gain it as in a transfer. <br>
    Entropy increases due to metabolism faster than the same substances gain entropy in the absence of life, and that makes metabolism entropically preferred. <br>
    <hr><br>
    "Most biological configuration spaces are so large and the targets they present are so small that blind search (which ultimately, on materialist principles, reduces
    to the jostling of life’s molecular constituents through forces of attraction and repulsion) is highly unlikely to succeed." Fails to put a number on it. Is there a
    standard name for 'fallacy due to innumeracy?', I think that is a neighbor of false dichotomy.<br>
    <br>
    "In the information-theory literature, information is usually characterized as the negative logarithm to the base two of a probability (or some logarithmic average
    of probabilities, often referred to as entropy)." Characterized is a strange synonym for 'measured'.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    "also cashing out conservation of information purely probabilistically."&nbsp; 'cashing out' is an autocorrect for 'casting our', although perhaps a bit of a
    Freudian slip since the author makes money on pablum such as this article promotes (an ad hominem attack on my part ;-).<br>
    <br>
    That is shortly followed by some tough to parse words which I translate as 'there is a cost to reducing a search space'. <br>
    <br>
    " so conservation of information says that increasing the probability of successful search requires additional informational resources that, once the cost of
    locating them is factored in, do nothing to make the original search easier."&nbsp; Here the pointed out fallacy of it requiring additional information to reduce a
    search space is made, with an implication that use of that information transfers it, without which the cost to the source of that additional information is zero. <br>
    <br>
    A model of possible search reducing machines is formed which requires that such machines do searches to reduce the space, making them a null actor. Jeez Louise is
    that the actual argument? If that model is essential for search space reduction then search spaces can not be reduced. Bayes would roll over in his grave.<br>
    <br>
    It took a boat load of words to get to the unproven assumption that search spaces require a search to be reduced. Perhaps a proof follows?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Nope. So:<br>
    <br>
    Dembski's argument fails because it presumes that information added to a search process that reduces the search space requires that said information is transferred
    and no longer available. Since there is no such transfer in biological evolution that cost is actually zero.<br>
    <br>
    While not stated explicitly there is within this thread of thought a failure to recognize the difference between the probability of 'some kind of life' vs 'our kind
    of life'. Not knowing how many different ways that sentience can form makes this not possible to compute. The best we can do is defined by Bayes: until we have
    another universe the estimate of ours being the way it is is 1.0.
