    <p>Dealing with arduino's simple project management</p>
    <p>Arduino's build system copies source files into a build directory. It generates header files for .ino files, it preprocesses
      the explicit c and c++ files in the directory. The project manager insists on all source being in the project directory, and
      all source in the project directory is compiled and linked. The linker command specifies removal of unreferenced items. The
      latter means that only the code that is used makes it into the binary, but it gets compiled and that takes time.<br>
      The project manager does not let you add to the compiler's include search path. You have to and more elaborated paths to you
      #include statements.</p>
    <p>Note that adding a file to a project via the Arduino IDE copies that file to the project directory, which is undesirable if
      that file is to be shared across projects.</p>
    <p>On linux or any similar OS one can use file links to leave one's library source in a file tree where it makes sense to you,
      but have it appear in the Arduino project. For each source directory I made a script like the following:<br>
      <br>
      ## link an ezcpp module to arduino dev<br>
      ln -s ../../ezcpp/$1 due/$1</p>
    <p>I then came up with a universal one:<br>
      ## make a link to the $1 file<br>
      ## see mkImports for a utility to manage them<br>
      ln -sf $1 $local<br>
      echo &gt;&gt;.gitignore $(basename $1)<br>
      <br>
      You pass it the pathname relative to the arduino project directory.<br>
      <br>
      If your SCCS doesn't deal well with file links then you can use the following script to generate a file that will regenerate
      the links you made, and you can save that script file in your sccs.<br>
    </p>
    <hr><code>## make a script that will rebuild links to external files<br>
      # this is needed as arduino insists on incorporating 100% of the .h and .cpp files it finds in each project directory.<br>
      # the 'add file' feature of the IDE *copies* the file into the current directory<br>
      # there is also no easy way to have a per-project list of include paths and lib paths. With difficulty one can set that up for
      all projects via editing a properties file in a hard to find location.<br>
      find . -type l -exec readlink {} \+ &gt;externals.list<br>
      rm -f importer<br>
      while read extname; do <br>
      &nbsp; echo &gt;&gt;importer ln -sf $extname <br>
      &nbsp; #this gets done too many places, will do this manually at need: echo &gt;&gt;.gitignore $(basename $extname) <br>
      done &lt;externals.list<br>
      <br>
      ## occasionally do the following:<br>
      # find . -type l -exec echo &gt;&gt;.gitignore {} \;<br>
      #<br>
      # to ignore links:<br>
      #<br>
      # find -type l&nbsp; -exec&nbsp; basename {} \; &gt;&gt;.gitignore <br>
      # sort .gitignore &gt;sort.tmp<br>
      # uniq &lt;sort.tmp &gt;.gitignore </code><br>
