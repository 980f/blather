    <h2>Dealing with arduino's simple project management</h2>
    <p>Arduino's build system copies source files into a build directory. It generates header files for .ino files, it preprocesses the explicit c and c++ files in the directory. <br>
      The project manager insists on all source being in the project directory, and all source in the project directory is compiled and linked. <br>
      The linker command specifies removal of unreferenced items. The latter means that only the code that is used makes it into the binary, but it gets compiled and that takes time.<br>
      The project manager does not let you add to the compiler's include search path. You have to add more elaborated paths to your #include statements.</p>
    <p>Note that adding a file to a project via the Arduino IDE copies that file to the project directory, which is undesirable if that file is to be shared across projects.</p>
    <p>On linux or any similar OS one can use file links to leave one's library source in a file tree where it makes sense to you, but have it appear in the Arduino project. For each source directory I made a script like the following:<br>
      <br>
      ## link an ezcpp module to arduino dev<br>
      ln -s ../../ezcpp/$1 due/$1</p>
    <p>I then came up with a universal one:<br>
      ## make a link to the $1 file<br>
      ## see mkImports for a utility to manage them<br>
      ln -sf $1 $local<br>
      echo &gt;&gt;.gitignore $(basename $1)<br>
      <br>
      You pass it the pathname relative to the arduino project directory.<br>
      <br>
      If your SCCS doesn't deal well with file links then you can use the following script to generate a file that will regenerate the links you made, and you can save that script file in your sccs.<br>
    </p>
    <hr><code>## make a script that will rebuild links to external files<br>
      # this is needed as arduino insists on incorporating 100% of the .h and .cpp files it finds in each project directory.<br>
      # the 'add file' feature of the IDE *copies* the file into the current directory<br>
      # there is also no easy way to have a per-project list of include paths and lib paths. With difficulty one can set that up for all projects via editing a properties file in a hard to find location.<br>
      find . -type l -exec readlink {} \+ &gt;externals.list<br>
      rm -f importer<br>
      while read extname; do <br>
      &nbsp; echo &gt;&gt;importer ln -sf $extname <br>
      &nbsp; #this gets done too many places, will do this manually at need: echo &gt;&gt;.gitignore $(basename $extname) <br>
      done &lt;externals.list<br>
      <br>
      ## occasionally do the following:<br>
      # find . -type l -exec echo &gt;&gt;.gitignore {} \;<br>
      #<br>
      # to ignore links:<br>
      #<br>
      # find -type l&nbsp; -exec&nbsp; basename {} \; &gt;&gt;.gitignore <br>
      # sort .gitignore &gt;sort.tmp<br>
      # uniq &lt;sort.tmp &gt;.gitignore </code><br>

    <h3>Arduino on Linux</h3>
    the version in the repo says it is 2.x but it is ancient compared to the website's 1.8.x (1.8.8 on 12feb2019).<br>
    <br>
    Load it from the website software tab.<br>
    receive a tar.xz, expand it somewhere handy.<br>

    <h3>Hacking the IDE</h3>
    <br>
    I forked the arduino github repo so that I could make wild changes without annoying anyone. The actual edits I made are rather small and local, but the effects of some of them are quite significant.<br>
    I made a number of changes to the IDE to smooth out operation with my library management habits. The biggest one was to (optionally) split vertical instead of horizontal since I have wide monitors.<br>
    <br>
    I used intellij IDEA and managed to get it to compile and run. To actually get it to run outside the IDE I had to use an installed version of the arduino IDE as the CWD to get to all the .jar files needed, not all are in the github repo AFAICT.<br>
    A recent rebuilding of my workspace found much of the win32 support missing, so I commented out as necessary to get the rest to compile. This is an example of one of Java's forever issues- unsophisticated build.<br>
    <br>
    Eventually I produce a jar of the cc.arduino bits and drop it into the installation directory lib folder to get something that runs without the java IDE.<br>
