    <h2>Maneuvers</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3> Tack</h3>
    Swings the bow through the wind.<br>
    <br>
    The fore course might be left set during the maneuver, but often is doused.<br>
    The spanker is brought amidships from the lee side which turns the bow into the wind (along with the rudder).<br>
    The headsails are eased with the spanker moving amdiships.<br>
    The courses are doused while still on the initial tack as the bow approaches the wind.<br>
    After the bow passes the wind the main stack is hauled to the new tack, the fore still is on the initial tack and slows the ship some. The headsails are backed to keep the rotation going, and the spanker is readied to move to the new tack.<br>
    The headsails and staysails are shifted once the new tack is certain.<br>
    The fore stack is hauled around.<br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h3>Wear</h3>
    Swings the stern through the wind.<br>
    <br>
    <em><strong>Diagram and text do not agree!</strong></em><br>
    <br>
    Spanker and rest&nbsp; of mizzen sails are doused.<br>
    The main course is doused and both fore and main stacks are braced square.<br>
    The mizzen 'stack' is moved to the new tack, but is still doused.<br>
    As the stern points into the wind the fore-n-aft sails are shifted.<br>
    Fore-n-aft are shifted, mizzen ones set.<br>
    As new heading is approached the spanker is set along with the rest of its stack.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h3>Box Haul</h3>
    A wear but first swing the bow into the wind then let the wind push the ship back through the first part of the subsequent wear.<br>
    <br>
    Spanker to midships starts the turn towards the wind.<br>
    The fore course is doused,<br>
    then the spanker is doused.<br>
    The main course is doused and the stack brought to square.<br>
    The fore stack is hauled to catch the wind backwards pushing the vessel backwards.<br>
    After the stern goes from lee to weather the fore is hauled around and is now filled normally.<br>
    The remainder is the same as a wear.<br>
    <br>
    The fore crew lay on the deck exhausted.<br>
