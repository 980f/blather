    <p>Special effects controllers</p>
    <hr> In this document numbers on items is for ease of discussion, don't pay
    much attention to their values. For instance in the programming definition
    section they do not reflect strict ordering of operations.<br>

      Booboxes are expensive and most people can't program them other than
      through their buttons (the cheaper ones).</p>
    <p>2 minutes maximum of animation (my design is limited by number of steps,
      not time, low end 127)<br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p><br>
      We would like to have an easy to program system for the majority of FX
      designers, emulating the Boobox interface as closely as convenient. Since
      arduino is programmed in C++ we can easily use the same code on lowend
      controllers as for RPi0W based ones.</p>
    <p>The Arduino would have a fixed program, an RPi0W would have that plus
      other programs running or an extended capability version (gotta love C++
      conditional compilation :).<br>
      <br>
      Internally there is a table for each available trigger.<br>
      Each line of the table (from now on called a <strong>step</strong>) has a
      duration (in .01 seconds or some other readily achievable granularity) and
      settings for each relay. <br>
      Each digitial output can be set to one of:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>On</li>
      <li>Off</li>
      <li>No change</li>
      <li>Flicker (random, prefer SSR over relay)</li>
      <li>Ramp (pwm with relaxing period, prefer SSR over relay)</li>
      <li>Others as we think of them.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We may be able to support multiple tables, one for each input. We may
      program conflict resolution per relay as:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>On wins (OR, greatest)</li>
      <li>Off wins (AND, least)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition each relay has a polarity option, "on" might actually be
      "off", IE we want to be able to switch from NO to NC without actually
      changing the wires.</p>
    <p>Programming interfaces</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Boobox button mode<br>
        A button interface is used to record on/off times for the channels. If
        you don't like the program you start from scratch to make any changes.</li>
      <li>Terminal Boobox<br>
        A terminal is connected via USB or UART (depends on arduino model) and
        the equivalent of the button functionality is done via keyboard
        characters. This and button mode can exist at the same time.</li>
      <li>Conversation over terminal, prompted with single char selections for
        each prompt.<br>
        ESC gets you up one level prompt<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Show table, Edit step, Insert step, Delete step,Save program, Load
            program.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Show: prints table nicely aligned, back to prompt level 1</li>
            <li>Save: prints table formatted for reading back in via Load.</li>
            <li>Load: expects stream of step definition lines.</li>
            <li>Edit:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>asked for which step, empty answer is "add new one at end"
                0..9 then A0..A9, B0..B9 which covers more steps than we have
                storage for.</li>
              <li>prompted for each relay setting</li>
              <li>prompted for duration</li>
              <li>prompted for whether "reset" is allowed.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Insert:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>prompts for number to insert at, if '3' then existing steps
                from 3rd step to end are moved to one greater, and you enter the
                Edit cycle for step 3.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Delete:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>prompts for number to delete<br>
                Note: deleted steps are stored in the config space and we will
                figure out how to ask to get one back.</li>
            </ol>
          </ol>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If we wish to have state machines then we will have tables enable and
      disable each other.</p>

    Boobox programming algorithm.<br>
    <br>
    Long press on PGM button resets program pointer to first step and puts
    device in program mode (reflected by some LED).<br>
    On release of the long press the relay buttons are recorded as the idle
    level of the outputs.<br>
    Short press on PGM starts duration measurement for step 1. The state of the
    relay buttons as PGM is pressed is the values for step 1.<br>
    As each relay's button changes state the program pointer moves to the next
    step and restarts duration measurement.<br>
    Short press on PGM ends recording and enters run state.<br>
    <br>
    In run mode:<br>
    <ol>
      <li> each relay button inverts state of relay, IE if program is running
        due to a trigger then the relay button complements the present output
        state.</li>
      <li>a quick press of PGM triggers the program run.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Boobox programming via terminal program:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Q is like a long PGM press: clears old program and sets pointer to
        step 1. YUIO and HJKL are used to set idle state of outputs. You can
        fiddle with them until you are happy, the results are recorded when A is
        received.</li>
      <li>A is like a short PGM press, starts measuring duration and records
        present state of relays.</li>
      <li>YUIO are relay on </li>
      <li>HJKL are relay off</li>
      <li>Z ends the program.</li>
    </ol>
    When any of YUIOHJKL are pressed a new step is recorded. If the duration of
    a step is less than some value we shall argue over then the step is merged
    with the following one. This is to extend the range of the step memory and
    we may defer such optimization until the table is full but the program not
    completed.<br>
    <hr><br>
    Program Maintenance<br>
    One of the primary desires is to be able to archive and restore programs,
    such as for rapid replacement of a broken unit. Via a terminal one can
    capture a program and play it into another box.&nbsp; <br>
    Programs are emitted and received as human readable text. A line is output
    for each step, in tab separated format with a header. This allows spread
    sheet programs to be used for convenience. Lines preceded with a '#' are
    ignored on upload, perhaps retained and regurgitated for archiving
    convenience. We might even recognize a line with nothing on it but a number
    and increment that number before writing back out if there has been any
    change.<br>
    <br>
    The Leonardo, the main target of this project, only has 1k bytes of EEPROM
    storage.<br>
    For easy programming each step needs a byte per relay and 2 bytes for a
    nicely ranged duration (&gt;10 minutes at .01 s). A program has a known
    number of steps, which could be held in a program description. Special
    duration values can be used to indicate things like "end of program" so that
    we don't have to keep a record of number of steps. We would use high values
    for these indicators, it may be very useful to use small values for "break
    before make" timings.<br>
    At a generous 8 bytes per step (2<sup>3</sup>) 1024 bytes (2<sup>10</sup>)
    leaves us with 128 available steps (2<sup>7</sup>).<br>
    <hr>Modularity<br>
    <br>
    Having controlled output boxes separate from the controllers adds wiring
    risk (slight) for a gain of being able to change our mind about which
    controller to use with each box. We can have 2 channel and 4 channel boxes
    each with a power tail and a 9-pin D or RJ-11 8 pin jack for the logic. <br>
    <br>
    Each controller is in a standard blue box with a toggle switch which gates
    the power to the control and to an outlet which is what the relay box can
    plug into if it is nearby. It would have a connector matching the power
    boxes.<br>
    <br>
    This division also handily allows for non A/C loads. We really should use
    12VDC instead of 120VAC when ever possible. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>Expansion:<br>
    <br>
    We occasionally may wish to link more than one box to get more active
    controls in a single program. With terminal programming we can program each
    group independently with the trigger signal shared. For precise timing
    coordination we can splice the durations from one table into the duration.<br>

    Low power/cost Arduino (Leonardo) vs Higher power Arduino vs RPi0W<br>
    <br>
    The Leonardo class controller can run on battery power. It is ~$3.<br>
    stm32 "blue pill" is same cost as Leonardo and has some audio capability but
    no sd card connector. For short clips its internal program space can hold
    the data, perhaps 32k bytes ogg encoded.<br>
    The higher power Arduinos add audio out capability and can also probably run
    on battery power. Adafruit M0 logger includes sdcard holder: $20+shipping.<br>
    RPi0W will eat through batteries compared to the others, but is $15 and has
    far more capability.<br>
    <br>
    An RPi0W makes the most sense when battery power is not required, and space
    isn't critical (the most common case). It can be programmed over WiFi and so
    no cable is needed and programs can be loaded from a central location. it
    has as much I/O as other systems and while not as swift at reaction it is
    sub millisecond which is fast enough for any human interface. Only a few
    robotics situations require the precision that the cheapest controllers
    provide.<br>
    The RPi0W <br>
    <hr>Sound<br>
    For the RPi0W any sound format is usable. Capacity is effectively unlimited
    given the size of the SD card.<br>
    For the low end opus format is the best. Good sound can be achieved at
    64kbaud. <br>
    2<sup>16</sup> bits per second with 4Mbits = 64 seconds for most circuit
    python systems. So let us not bother with considering sound for the low end
    systems.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    <hr><br>
    But what about costs?<br>
    <br>
    RPi0W: $15 bare, $32 with case and P/S. and HDMI adapators and pins.<br>

    <hr>Physical connectivity<br>
    <br>
    RJ-45 cables can be purchased in various lengths and have 4 twisted pairs
    which is quite useful when Tesla coils are operating nearby, or other sparky
    things.<br>
    <p> <br>
      One pinout would be +5V:Gnd, one trigger in, 2 controls out. I think that
      would handle a large set of our use cases. One could also format that as
      +5V:Gnd, and any mix of 6 digital signals, such as 2 in 4 out.<br>
      <br>
      It might make more sense to have separate input and output connectors. The
      input connector would support an external programming panel via uart
      connections.<br>
      <br>
      The programming panel is one of our controllers with buttons and status
      lights which uses its uart to talk to the uart port of the effect
      controller. IE by plugging in a dumb panel to one control box we can use
      it to program others. </p>
