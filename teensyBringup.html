    <p>Teensy development setup</p>
    <ol>
      <li>When they say they aren't done with 1.8.1 compatibility they mean it, they don't even give you a chance to try it. </li>
      <li>They ask for an Arduino directory, without saying whether they want the code/install directory of the IDE or some other
        thing=&gt;the '?' button explains what they want indirectly by showing a program log that lists what they are looking for.
        They check version in lib/version.txt, but then start checking library versions and the <i><b>size</b></i> of certain
        classes!</li>
      <li>installer only accepts file picking, doesn't let you type the address.</li>
      <li>shitload of libraries. Doesn't give a size by each so I am installing all and will delete them later as I don't want to do
        a reinstall and have that potentially destroy work I've done in the meantime.</li>
