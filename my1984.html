<i>This starts with a transription with minor corrections from a
letter that I wrote Paige shortly after meeting her other boyfriend in
person. [items in brackets like these] are added at this later writing.</i>
<p>The big secret that I've been holding back (If I told you about this
then my mind had blanked it out). This will get confusing.
<p><font size=+4>Clare killed my child!</font>
<br>I tried everything I could think of (this time) to mke her not have
an abortion. The child would have been born winter 1984/85. Early in '84
some white trash moved in next door. I wanted to ask my neighbor to not
rent to these two couples, but I didn't want to seem prejudiced. I was
reacting to the way they trespassed upon my property when viewing the one
they were to rent.
<br>I had been working hard for about 2.5 years to cajole, instruct, force
Clare to take some of the responsibility for the welfare of the family.
[the working hard started after my mother died]. Having to do so eroded
my respect for her, eroding my desire for her, eroding my sexuality - I
felt like I was commiting incest with a teenage daughter rather than having
sex with a wife.
<br>With trash to hang out with I felt Clare would instantly revert, which
she did. At first it was just hanging out drinking a bit. Then she started
helping them out with $10 here, $50 there [much more money than I ever
spent on myself]. Despite which one of the couples tried to steal from
us.
<br>The only decent one of the 4 was Judy. She came over a month or so
after they moved in to let us know that her brother was going to live with
them for a while. He was being paroled, he was a house burglar. I though
it both decent and prudent for her to inform us. then I looked at Clare's
face and could tell that she was going to have an affair with him. She
hadn't met him yet but, as was explained by statements she made much later,
the fact that he was criminal was exciting - she felt free to use him with
no regard to his feelings. That last part is a direct quote.
<p>Back at the bat cave...
<p>My sister, Sarah nee Marion, had divorced her abusive husband some months
earlier after nearly 10 years of marriage. She finally discarded some of
the hsot visited upon her by our father and decided to find something better.
She got pregnant almost immediately - they were so drunk that they forgot
to use a condom. The guy's first response was "if you try to get child
support out of me you'll never see me again".
<br>Morning sickness was so bad that she was eventually hospitalized for
dehydration and weight loss. When she stabilized she moved from Colorado
to Austin. The cost of living is less and homelessness is viable here.
I was living in Houston.
<br>She got a job as an architectural draftsman. They fired her when they
found out she was pregnant. She got a free-lance job with a UT professor
who happened to be the only man I've had sex with (limited to massage parlor
type massage - I discovered that I was am definitely heretero-sexual).
He then referred her on to a life-saver of a job - with the man who happened
to be Clare's boyfirend before me. This wasn't known by anyone at the time
she got the contract.
<p>We're now most of the way back to where Clare was delighted at the prospect
of having a criminal she could fuck and discard. I was being blackmailed
with this even though no such words were uttered. If I refused to do something
she would upon my arrival home from work the next day immediately go next
door and not return until late. At first I acceded to the black mail. The
bank account was again began to be drained. My sister asked me to be her
backup labor coach. Her primary one was Rebecca, the woman who started
the volunteer labor coach program at Brackenridge hospital, who later became
my sister's ex-husband's girl friend.
<p>(Better than a soap opera...)
<p>My memories of birth and the revelations that provided me was a sore
point between me and Clare. I used that and my other recollections of early
childhood to defend my positions on child rearing issues. I chose to help
coach my sister more to determine if I had really tamed (bad word but we'll
have to use it for now) the traumatic reaction to them.(Turned out to be
irrelevent - labor coaching is not reminiscent of being born, while having
intercourse is).
<br>Clare had a few valid but petty reasons to not like Sarah. Clare told
me to not go help her, that Sarah was just tring to manipulate me. I never
got straight how asking for emotional support in trying times was manipulative.
<br>This time the blackmail of having an affair was almost explicit. I
decided that helping my sister was more important to me than my wife's
fidelity. The infidelity would (it seemed) simply reduce our relationship
to zero, leaving a clean slate to start rebuilding from rather than trying
to rescue what we had.
<br>I helped Sarah through two days of induced labor that ended in a C-section.
"We'll have the baby right out" was followed by 20 minutes of me doing
calisthenics, no lfoors to sweep or laundry to fold. the rest of that story
is beautiful and I will not soil it with any greater proximity to the rest
of this narrative.
<p>Clare was sooo friendly when I returned. For the next few months she
behaved the way I had been asking her to for years: the house was clean,
the kids were fed when hungry.
<br>And she spent most of every evening with the neighbors. She asked me
to form a freindship with the burglar Tony. She had me work on his car
for him. This did confuse me a bit, reduced my confidence in my belief
that they were screwing.
<br>Then she started changing into nothing but a dressing gown that didn't
even fully cover her butt before going to visit. We ahd started sleeping
in different rooms. I forgot the excuses given that I knew the reality.
And then some things happened that caused me to disconnect from reality.
<br>I knew what was going on but was behaving as if I believed all her
lies. Things will get weird here as the duality of personae (internal and
external) diverged my ability to put events in order declined.
<br>The way Clare works, if she weren't having an affair and I accused
her of one that would be justification for having one. "If I am going to
be punished I deserve to have the pleasure of the crime".
<br>In our own sexual activity she insisted on at least having Hannah (nursing
toddler) in bed with us. That meant that I had to suppress grunts, groans,
moans etc, which I'd found just recently to be necessary for me to have
gratifying sex. She then forbid me to touch her breasts. The one time many
years previous that I tried cunning linguistics (when Hannah's birth was
still too recent to allow for intercourse) the response was negative, and
given that she was fucking another guy not too appealing for me. Her game
was to justify having sex with the other guy cuase I was not satisfactory,
but she on teh other hand was now the otherwise perfect wife. she also
refused to touch my genitals or my butt or my nipples, but in each instance
not until after I requested that she do so.
<p>Somewhere in here it abruptly hit me that she wasn't using birth control.
Somehwere in here a news report on a prison escapee that hijacked a family
triggered a premonitory dream that she would get or at least risk getting
prgranant by a criminal. I had other intense dreams of slaving to edge
of near fatal exhaustion for her - while she's fucking her boyfriend behind
my back.
<p>I woke up one night fondling Max -who thankfully didn't wake up. (Clare
had split us into boy's bedroom and girl's bedroom). I was only rubbing
his chest, I woke up when I rolled over to kiss and opened my eyes. I had
a surge of inchaote panic. Shortly thereafter I made a bunk bed for me
&amp; Max, he of course got the top bunk - mor enice stuff here that I
also will not soil with the misery that will drip off my pen this night.
<p>In the stuffiness of my bunk recollectiosn of my tonsillectomy ( age
4) came back with primal intensity. I was confused because they seemed
irrelevent to what was going on. But they fueled a fear that I had sunk
so deeply into depression (possibly wrong term) that I would never be able
to clinb out. feat that everything with Clare was a sick fantasy of mine.
<p>Then I was hit with a confused memory that seemed to be of my father
fucking in my mouth. Much later in therapy I figured out what had happened
- but even when first plagued with the impressions I didn't believe it
had really happened - 99% sure it didn't happen, he is disgusting but not
evil. [Now I am beginning to swing back the other way, he did do explicitly
sexual things to me, itemized in other writings]. Nonetheless, to have
some trauma begging for attention, and of a magnitude to overshadow birth
and abusive surgery [at 9 years old], fed my despair of ever regaining
sanity. [One night during a point of emotional exhaustion from the memories
I as directly as she would allow asked her about her affair, "Do friends
have sex with friends? No. What is your relationship with Tony? we're friends"
cycled over and over again 'til I got tired of asking].
<br>And then I cold tell from her body that she was pregnant. All I could
do was drop subtle hints to let her know I knew. the despair began to lift.
Tony took off to Georgia todo some burglaries. when aboritoned was mentioned
on TV I would speak up stating that "only extreme poverty or rape (and
incest is rape and it pisses me off when it is treated separately) justify
abortion." I even had sex with her one morning on a day that could be used
to claim the child was mine, albeit pre-mature.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<blockquote>A quick break occured here for a little writhing in agony.</blockquote>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>She even stated as I finished up "you know that might have gotten me
pregnant."
<blockquote>A quick brag: I knew she was pregnant a week or two before
she missed a period. She never understood how attuned to her I was, except
to use it to manipulate me as per the unvoiced sexual blackmail.</blockquote>
Any hoo...
<br>Having my reality vindicated was a weak consolation for being cuckolded.
I wrestled with that thing about my father as well, and I was doing some
of the best engineering work in my life. I decided to love this child without
any of the compromises I had made with max adn Hannah, tolerating Clare's
mild [usually] abuse of them to maintain my dependency relationship on/with
Clare. Tony was gone, soon engouh back in jail so I was feeling in a powerful
position to build a family.
<br>And tehn one afternoon just lying about in the liveing room, lying
close to Clare she says with a timid smile "I started my period today".
This is not something she had ever said to me before, not something we
ever discussed and was unrelated to the conversation.
<br>My first reaction, of whic I am very ashamed, was of relief. Saved
by some magical event from having to love another kid, from having to deal
with the affair, from having my family back to the original four without
any effort.
<br>To my credit it was only a few breaths later that I realized she'd
had an abortion.
<br>I imploded. I froze internally. In bed that night the agony started.
<p>Eight Years Earlier (and you thought this was almost over) ...
<p>Cutting this part short:
<br>Clare moved in with me on a few day's acquaintance with the intent
of having a child. We screwed like minks for a few weeks before I timidly
asked "what kind of birth control are you using?". She replied, timidly,
"uh...none." A sensation similar to plugging all my extremities into wall
sockets washed through me [I know whereof I speak, I have plugged individual
limbs in]. After a bit of a discussion I agreed to this. An idyllic period
of nearly debilitating sex ensued.
<br>She got pregnant.
<br>She got morning sickness.
<br>I started planning on dropping out of school to get a full time job
to support a family.
<br>She called her mother, the dearly departed [just this february] Joanne,
to tell her the news and before Clare can speak Joanne fires off on how
Clare had better never try to bring a kid home to Joanne's house to raise.
<br>After the phone call Clare starts coming up with things to be afraid
of. "How will we do blah? How can we afford that?" I asnwer her rationally,
with the beginnings of worry tinging my thoughts. One day she says that
she is going to get an abortion. I fuck up an deliver up the feminist rhetoric
about it being her right, but that I really could take care of the three
of us. The next day she killed that child.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Back to 1984</blockquote>
Now a second child has been killed and I view it as being due to my persoanl
weaknesses. I should have been able to prevent the deaths - my fears of
being aline forever ifI left Clare crippled me from doint what was needed
to save the kid. I had already picked out a name for him/her: Robert/Roberta
after a misogynist friend of mine.
<br>A few sleepless days followed, I see a counselor who is a fuckup. Up
to that point I had not thought of suicide. That night I started thinking
about it. I criticized myself for such thoughts, that they are the result
of repressed birth memories, that suicide attempts are indirect attempts
at getting attention. [Direct attempts are approved by my personal censor,
it is symbolic acts that offend it]
<br>Then every pore of my body starts stinging. Every single pore feels
like a dull nail has been rammed into it. I have never felt anything like
it before or since. It didn't fade. I went into the kitchen and started
sawing through the side of my neck with a steak knife. As the blood flows
down my neck and over my breast some of the stinging fades. I am thinking
that the life insurance should be enough money that Clare won't abuse the
children. As I prepare to bear down harder I think I hear Hannah calling
out for me. She had started doing so when Clare started staying late next
door.
<br>And then I heard a friend of mine, Tina Kimmel, telling me about her
father's suicide. I was left to understand its emotrioanl effect on her
at the time. It had been about 12 years earlier when she actually told
me the story.
<br>I put down the knife, mopped up the blood, and life went on.
<br>I hve left some things out over the period of those few days or weeks,
or was it months...
<p>Then the nasty personal type stuff started. Things got weird, things
got worse.
<br>Tony returned and Clare wanted to leave me to go to him. She confided
in a friend that was mroe my friend and tings were finally out in the open.
The courts got involved, my constitutional rights and the last chance to
pull the marriage together got trampled by a judge. Friends came out of
the woodwork like cockroaches. couldn't get rid of them! Even with poison!
A neighbor moved in with Clare to take care of the kids when I moved out,
an 18 year old girl.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>Ever since I have been dedicated to protecting my kids from their motther,
whom they lived with. I was forced to be dishonest in order to get Clare
to behave.
<br>Clare tried to get pregnant by me a few toems over the next 2 years.
Every persona I tried to fabricate to make life with her tolerable failedme.
I screwed her just enough to keep her from finding someone else while I
put her through school to get a master's in education. I "typed her papers
up for her" since I had a home computer when computers were still rare.
In actuality I rewrote the papers so that she would pass.
<br>The court threw out the final papers beacuse we were a day past a time
limit. I had to refile and wait another 90 days but I couldn't take it
anymore, and never had sex with her again (stopped a month before the divorce
was orignally due). Within a month she was pregnant, by the first handy
male, a drifter living in the neighborhood. [That child is Daniel, who
calls me Dad. It is getting to where I have spent as much time with him
as with my biological children]
<br>Life goes on.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>A hell of a mess to slog through just because I'm jealous of Paige's
other boy friend. Paige's reaction to receiving the above memoir was to
tell me to take it to a therapist. I continued the relationship with her,
but jealousy kept on increasing. Leading into the next set of stuff, the
slowly resolving details of what my father did to me as an infant.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>The following item came up when I was rushing back from a weekend visit
to Daniel to be with Paige. I had that morning written Paige a letter detailing
a good experience- the loss of my virginity. I offered this as a counter
weight to the rather black stuff layed out above. During the drive I was
getting flashes of what follows, causing me to shake my head violently
from side to side, not a good idea while driving at 70 mph .
<p>I didn't have a cell phone then so I was going to stop off at work on
the way into town to let her know I had come back early, she lives across
the street from where I was working. I noticed Joe's truck parked outside
and that fired off a surge of feeling. I went home and cried and rolled
around and remembered:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>My father would kiss my cheek triggering the rooting response
(nipple seeking reflex) causing me to turn my face into his and open my
mouth so that I was "kissing" him on the lips. I was very hungry and this
angered and shocked and disgusted me - I NEEDED FOOD!</blockquote>
The following set is stuff that surfaced during therapy when I was 18 and
19, recently brought back to mind due to being in the same time frame of
my life: diaper changes.
<ul>
<li>
I peed on my father's hand - he spanked me hard enough for my cheeks to
shake from the shock wave going through my body.</li>

<li>
His mother did the same due to my squirming, not hard but hard enough.
The sound was as frightening as the impact, I still had visceral remembrance
of being swung by the ankles and spanked at birth (I can provide that memoir
if you wish, validated by my mom).</li>

<li>
Mom's mom responded to the squirming by yanking my legs out straight, hard.
She spoke harsh but unintelligible words.</li>

<li>
Mom once accidentally jabbed me to the bone with a diaper pin. She backed
off and seemed scared. I chose not to cry, I didn't want her to leave me.</li>
</ul>
A little prose written during a break in the thrashing and crying:
<blockquote>"My traumas are like a rock around which my living flesh is
wrapped like a starfish at low tide."</blockquote>
The next stuff hasn't resolved very well yet. I am being treated for the
massive phlegm flow that has been choking me. There are events (multiple/cronic)
where I am having trouble breathing and my cries result in a bottle being
shoved in my mouth obscuring the hole through which I am breathing. I suck
the bottle down as fast as I can so that I can get back to breathing.
<p>Somewhere in here the feelings reminded me (the infant me) of some aspects
of birth, specifically throwing up in the womb and swallowing amniotic
fluid right back in. This would occur after a contraction faded. I had
many feelings of despair during labor, cycling with fear of death. At least
I didn't have to breathe during labor!
<p>Fingers are shoved in my mouth, medical tools are shoved in my mouth,
digusting fluids flow down my throat, the bottle is shoved in my mouth,
and I just want to be held and to have clear air passages to breathe through.
I <i>infer</i> that my father applied his peculiar mode of comforting to
me directly after some sort of treatment. His way of comforting is to cling
to you in a smothering fashion, to provide himself comfort.
<p>Clearer memories swell up to conciousness of my father kissing my belly.
His beard tickles my thighs and crotch. He fondles my penis until it is
very hard, of which I have mixed feelings, a primal fear of being eaten
amplified by subconcious memories (at that time) of circumcision. Parts
of this are things I remember reliving in therapy long ago, gaining some
more context now.
<p>And the key memory that slips away from me each time I approach it:&nbsp;
something pressing up between my legs, rubbing on my chest. Is it a warm
wash cloth? Is it my father's bearded face? Is it a diaper straight from
the clothes dryer?
<p>And as a footnote, rendered less humorously in some of my other writings:
<blockquote>One fine spring day my mother is giving me a bath, in a basinette.
She smiles slightly as she holds me under the clear water. My thoughts
which I attempt to send to her through facial expressions: "Ha ha this
is fun you can let me up now. Really, it was a blast but that's over we
can go back to bathing me. Uh, I could really use some air here." TO myself:
Oh fuck I want to breathe, if I cry I'll drown, THINK THINK!
<br>And so I smile, I can remember the bubbles escaping from the corners
of my mouth. I smile really sweetly and she lets me up.
<br>This recollection brought to you by the movie "O Lucky Man" starring
Malcolm McDowell. If you can sit through to the final scene you'll get
the connection.</blockquote>
